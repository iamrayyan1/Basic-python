# Create a Bus child class that inherits from the Vehicle class. The default fare charge of any
# vehicle is seating capacity * 100. If Vehicle is Bus instance, we need to add an extra 10%
# on full fare as a maintenance charge. So total fare for bus instance will become the final
# amount = total fare + 10% of the total fare. [2 marks]
