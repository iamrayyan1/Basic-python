# there are different paradigms of programming languages.

# now you have to return two variables, name and the house. you have to return student as whole
# We can return multiple values, also we can do this by dictionary
    return name, house      # returning as tuple
    # return (name, house)    returning tuple
    # return [name, house]    returning list
# we can receive these return values as: "name, house = get_student()" in our main function
# Basically we have use "tuple" in this case. tuple is another type of data in python that's a collection of values like x,y or x,y,z
# It is similar to a list but, it's immutable. A list is mutable meaning you go to the location of specific values and change the value there.
# But if you have no intention of changing the values of variables and you want to effectively return multiple values, you can return it as tuple by just using a comma
# immutable means you cannot change the values.
# you are actually returning one variable that is a tuple that contains two values/things
# we use tuple if we don't want to change the values in the variable to avoid error/bugs

# using OOP concepts, classes, objects
# making student a data type
# a class is a blueprint for pieces of data. class allow you to invent your own data type and create it's objects/variables
# objects are called instances of class. we can access variables and functions inside class using (.) notation and objects of classes

# Properties, Getters and Setters:
# By default, all variables and methods are public by default
# Things are made private to prevent illegal access to any other function outside class.
# Properties is an attribute that have more defense mechanism, more functionality implemented by you to prevent programmers from messing things up.
# A keyword known as "@property" which is technically a function. There are some @ syntax that allows you to decorate functions.
# In python you have decorators which are functions that modify the behavior of other functions
# By using getters and setters, we are trying to prevent programmers from illegally accessing variables outside class
# To set and get a variable, you require to pass through a function or method called getter and setter respectively.
# we can put any error correction inside these function to prevent any wrong input inside these  variables.
# so whenever a programmer will try to modify the value of a variable it will pass through setter function
# Before getter function you need to write a decorator called "@property", while before setter function we write "@house.setter"
# first getter is written than setter.
# The @property decorator allows you to define a method as a property.
# The @house.setter decorator is used to define the setter method for the house property.
# we can keep all our error checking inside setter function, no need to write it inside init function
# whenever we will call ".house" getters and setters will be called so to for convention we use "._house" at some places where these methods are not required

# @classmethod: it is use to specify that this method is not implicitly an instance method that has access to 'self'(the object itself). rather it is a class method that's not going to have access to self but it does know what class it's inside
